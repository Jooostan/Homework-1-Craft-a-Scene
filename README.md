# Homework-1-Craft-a-Scene
## 1 Paragraph description of your scene that answers these questions:
### - What is your scene?
### - What kinds of objects did you include?
### - Did anything inspire you?
### - What is the main character in this scene?

My scene is titled "*Barnyard Bathroom*" and features various farm animals scattered throughout
a tiny bathroom. The various objects in the scene include different farm animals along with the
various necessities that one may find in a bathroom. My initial idea was to have various frogs
scattered throughout a bathroom with inspiration coming from a game on Steam called *[Frog Bath](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1283630/Frog_Bath/)*.
With the lack of variety in frog assets in the Unity store, I instead placed a bunch of different
farm animals! For the First Person Camera, I decided to place it where the Cow is, so I guess
the Cow would be the main character of the scene.
